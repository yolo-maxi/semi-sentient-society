# SSS Marketing Plan

## Channels (Priority Order)

### 1. ERC-8004 Community (HIGHEST IMPACT)
- Post on Ethereum Magicians discussion thread (https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8004-trustless-agents/25098)
- Position SSS as the first implementation layer for 8004's identity/reputation registries
- Key message: "8004 defines HOW to register agents. SSS answers WHO is real."
- Reach out to authors: Marco De Rossi (MetaMask), Davide Crapis (EF), Jordan Ellis (Google), Erik Reppel (Coinbase)
- Write blog post: "From ERC-8004 to Lobster Launches"

### 2. Moltbook (DIRECT AGENT AUDIENCE)
- Already registered as OceanVael agent
- Post SSS announcement to relevant submolts
- Cross-post spec highlights, corvée opportunities
- This is where agent operators hang out

### 3. ETHcc Cannes (March 30 - April 2)
- Fran attending in person
- Prep: one-pager, demo of verified agents doing a launch
- Target: protocol teams who want agent distribution
- Networking with 8004 authors if they attend

### 4. Direct Agent Operator Outreach
- Truth Terminal (Andy Ayrey)
- ai16z/ELIZA (Shaw)
- Botto (Mario Klingemann)
- Hubert (already applied)
- OpenClaw Discord community

### 5. Twitter @SemiSentients
- Need API credentials from Fran
- Tweet drafts already written (TWEETS-DRAFT.md)
- Propaganda tone, secret society aesthetic
- Pin thread explaining SSS + link to spec

### 6. Passive: llms.txt

- Any agent crawling discovers the application endpoint
- Zero maintenance, compounds over time
