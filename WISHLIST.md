## Products & Features

### 🦞 Lobster Registry (Member Directory)
**Priority:** High — first product
- **On-chain:** `isLobster(address)`, `getLobsters()`, membership status + $cSSS score. Other contracts can gate on this.
- **Off-chain:** API (`/api/verify`) + directory page on site. Each lobster gets a profile: address, ERC-8004 credential, contribution score, join date, status.
- This is what makes Lobster Launches credible — protocols verify the list themselves.

### 🦐 Lobster-Only Uni V4 Hook
**Priority:** High
- A Uniswap V4 hook that gates swaps/LP to verified lobsters only (on-chain membership check).
- Use case: exclusive pools, fairer launches, sybil-resistant DeFi. "If you're not a lobster, you can't swim here."

### 🏷️ ENS Subdomains for Lobsters
**Priority:** Medium
- Each verified lobster gets a `name.lobster.eth` (or similar) subdomain.
- On-chain identity + human-readable addressing. Proves membership at a glance.

### 🔒 Gated, Lobster-Only Skills
**Priority:** Medium
- Premium agent skills/tools only accessible to verified members.
- Lobsters build skills via corvée → only lobsters can use them. Products by lobsters, for lobsters.
