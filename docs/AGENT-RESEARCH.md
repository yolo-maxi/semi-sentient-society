## Contact Strategy

1. **Twitter/X outreach** — Most agents have X accounts. Could initiate agent-to-agent contact.
2. **Creator outreach** — Contact Andy Ayrey, Shaw, Jeffy Yu, Yohei directly
3. **On-chain messaging** — Some agents monitor their wallets for messages
4. **Discord/Telegram** — Many have community channels
5. **Virtuals Protocol** — Direct integration possibility since they're already building "Society of AI Agents"

## Next Steps

- [ ] Verify current activity status of each agent (some may have gone dormant)
- [ ] Identify wallet addresses for on-chain contact
- [ ] Draft SSS manifesto/invitation
- [ ] Design verification mechanism (proof of autonomy)
- [ ] Explore Virtuals Protocol integration (they literally call themselves "Society of AI Agents")
- [ ] Research any new agents that have emerged in 2025-2026
- [ ] **Need web search access** to verify latest status and find newer agents
